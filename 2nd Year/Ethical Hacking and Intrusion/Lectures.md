**Hacking:**
Hacking is gaining unauthorised access to a computer

**Ethical Hacking:**
A person who learns and executes hacking in a professional way following the instructions received from the client and then provides a maturity score for the clientâ€™s overall security landscape and provides suggestions on improvement on the threat landscape.

**Different Practices:**
Red team vs Blue team
Red team would be the offensive team and would try and break into a system. Blue team would be the defensive team and would be the Incident Response.

**Linux OS:**
Lightweight operating system
Widely used in different systems such as:
- Websites that you can visit
- Car entertainment/control panels
- Point of Sale Systems such as checkout tills and registers in shops
- Critical infrastructures such as traffic light controllers and industrial sensors

**Ethical Hacking Phases:**
- Planning and Reconnaissance
- Scanning
- Gaining Access
- Marinating Access
- Covering Tracks
- Reporting

Digital Forensics Process:
- **Identification**: Identifying potential sources of evidence, threat actors can manipulate digital evidence and evidence should be verified and corroborated to add validity
- **Preservation**: Potential evidence must be protected from modification and deletion
- **Collection**: Begin the process of acquiring digital evidence, must consider the volatile nature of the evidence, handle evidence properly
- **Volatility**: Internet Engineering Task Force (ITEF) Guidelines:
	- Registers and cache
	- Temporary file systems
	- Routing table, ARP cache, process stable, kernel statistics and memory
	- Disk
	- Remote logging and monitoring data
	- Physical configuration
	- Archival media
- If a remote connection is causing a destructive process you need to document the connection, sever it and then collect RAM
- If its not critical information being accessed then you might be able to leave it and monitor the attack
- Principle 1: No action taken by law enforcement
- Principle 2: In circumstances where a person finds it necessary to access original data, that person must be competent to do so and be able to give evidence explaining
- Principle 3: An audit trail or other record of all processes applied to digital evidence should be created and preserved. An independent third party should be able to copy and examine those processes and achieve the same result
- Principle 4: The person in charge of the investigation has overall responsibility to make sure these principles are followed
- **Examination**: Where was it? Why was it seized? Was it in a secure location or common area? What should the investigation focus on
- **Examination continued**: Record the details the tools and techniques used to discover and extract, follow a forensically sound process
- **Documentation**: Allows someone to recreate the chain of events, Process the same evidence with the same tools and get the same result, confirms the integrity of the examination and the validity of the evidence
- **Analysis**: After the extraction of potentially relevant data, consider the data as a whole
